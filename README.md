# Hybrid Movie Recommender System

This project implements a **Hybrid Recommender System** combining **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering**.

## Datasets
- `movies.csv` – Movie titles and genres.
- `ratings.csv` – User ratings of movies.

## Features
- Content-Based Filtering (genres similarity)
- Collaborative Filtering (user-item ratings)
- Hybrid Recommendations (weighted combination)
- Example recommendations for test users

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`.
3. Run `Hybrid_Recommender.ipynb` or `Hybrid_Recommender.py`.
4. See top movie recommendations for any user and movie.

## Reflection
- Content-based works well for similar genres.  
- Collaborative works better for diverse recommendations.  
- Hybrid method combines strengths of both.
